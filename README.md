Diabetic data classification:

Overview
We will be predicting that whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features we will provide to our machine learning model, and for that, we will be using the famous Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Inspiration
Let's build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
